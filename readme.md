This small makefile has three objectives:

-   Generate PDF files from markdown sources using `pandoc`. (`make file.md` for
    a specific file or `make` for all `.md` files)

-   Standardize all markdown files in the current directory. (`make standard`)

-   View the generated files using `xdg-open`. (`make view`)
